Last year (2014) a link was sent around in the design and development community that made everyone stop and question their abilities: aprilzero.com. Besides the incredible amount of information and precise design details, AprilZero is peppered with these subtle animations that make the website feel alive and gives it a human like pulse. Anand Sharma leveled up the entire internet with the true potential of HTML5 and CSS3 animations.

Taking something mundane like copious amounts of raw data and subsidizing it with design and animations is a strategy that works for all kinds of scenarios: describing deeply technical infrastructure, walking someone through a sign up flow, and showing API documentation and usage.

Of course not all animation is useful. Knowing when and how to use animation is part art form and part knowing best practices, but when used well animation can make communication a whole lot easier.

If you’ve never done animation before don’t worry, it's actually pretty straightforward.
